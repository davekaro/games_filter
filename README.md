Crossfit Games Filter - http://games-affiliate.herokuapp.com/

The [Crossfit Games](http://http://games.crossfit.com/) site has its [own leaderboard](http://games.crossfit.com/leaderboard) and visitors can create a [custom leaderboard](http://games.crossfit.com/lboards/CustomLeaderboard), but I wanted to build my own flavor in Rails.

I get crushed at [Crossfit Wicked](http://www.crossfitwicked.com/) and some friends at work get crushed at [Crossfit Southie](http://crossfitsouthie.com/), so those are the only affiliates in the mix for now.

TODO:
- [ ] fix #2
- [ ] create a specific view for Wicked and Southie affiliates
- [ ] break out tables based off of gender and Games age groupings
- [ ] spice up the design a bit instead of lame bootstrap

Possible additions:
- [ ] pull down scores for some other affiliates?
- [ ] pull down scores from 2012?
- [ ] create some more cooler views with some of the scoring data, maybe with some comparisons of 2012 vs. 2013 scores?
